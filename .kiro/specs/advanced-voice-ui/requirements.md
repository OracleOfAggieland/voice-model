# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will transform the current basic voice model interface into a cutting-edge, engaging UI that provides users with an immersive and visually appealing experience during voice interactions. The current implementation shows a black screen when the voice model activates, which creates a poor user experience. The new UI will feature modern visual elements, real-time feedback, contextual information display, and interactive components that make voice conversations feel natural and engaging.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see an engaging visual interface when the voice model is active, so that I feel connected to the AI and understand the conversation state.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the voice session starts THEN the system SHALL display an animated, visually appealing interface instead of a black screen
2. WHEN the AI is speaking THEN the system SHALL show dynamic visual feedback with audio-reactive animations
3. WHEN I am speaking THEN the system SHALL display real-time voice input visualization with different styling than AI speech
4. WHEN the conversation is idle THEN the system SHALL show a subtle ambient animation indicating readiness to listen

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see conversation context and history during voice interactions, so that I can follow the discussion and reference previous points.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a voice conversation is active THEN the system SHALL display a real-time transcript of both user and AI speech
2. WHEN new messages are added THEN the system SHALL auto-scroll to show the latest content while preserving scroll position if user has scrolled up
3. WHEN the conversation contains financial data THEN the system SHALL highlight key numbers, percentages, and financial terms
4. WHEN I want to review previous conversation points THEN the system SHALL allow me to scroll through conversation history without interrupting the voice session

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want interactive controls and quick actions during voice conversations, so that I can efficiently manage the session and access related features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the voice session is active THEN the system SHALL provide easily accessible controls for mute, pause, and stop
2. WHEN I want to switch between voice and text input THEN the system SHALL provide a seamless toggle without ending the session
3. WHEN the AI mentions specific financial topics THEN the system SHALL display relevant quick action buttons (e.g., "Show Portfolio", "Calculate", "Save Note")
4. WHEN I need to access additional features THEN the system SHALL provide contextual menu options that don't interrupt the voice flow

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see relevant contextual information and data visualizations during financial conversations, so that I can better understand the advice being provided.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the AI discusses financial metrics THEN the system SHALL display relevant charts, graphs, or data cards
2. WHEN portfolio or investment topics are mentioned THEN the system SHALL show contextual financial widgets
3. WHEN calculations are performed THEN the system SHALL display the results in an easy-to-read format alongside the voice conversation
4. WHEN market data is referenced THEN the system SHALL show real-time or recent market information in sidebar panels

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the interface to be responsive and work well on different screen sizes, so that I can use the voice feature on various devices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using the application on desktop THEN the system SHALL display a full-featured layout with all visual elements optimally positioned
2. WHEN using the application on tablet THEN the system SHALL adapt the layout to prioritize voice visualization and essential controls
3. WHEN using the application on mobile THEN the system SHALL provide a streamlined interface focused on voice interaction and key information
4. WHEN the screen orientation changes THEN the system SHALL automatically adjust the layout to maintain usability

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want smooth animations and transitions that enhance the voice experience, so that the interface feels polished and professional.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN transitioning between different voice states THEN the system SHALL use smooth, purposeful animations
2. WHEN new content appears THEN the system SHALL animate elements in with appropriate easing and timing
3. WHEN voice visualization changes THEN the system SHALL provide fluid transitions between different visual states
4. WHEN UI elements are interacted with THEN the system SHALL provide immediate visual feedback with micro-animations

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want accessibility features in the voice interface, so that I can use the application regardless of my abilities or preferences.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using screen readers THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate ARIA labels and announcements for voice state changes
2. WHEN I have hearing difficulties THEN the system SHALL provide visual indicators for all audio cues and states
3. WHEN I prefer reduced motion THEN the system SHALL respect the user's motion preferences while maintaining functionality
4. WHEN using keyboard navigation THEN the system SHALL provide full keyboard access to all voice controls and features
